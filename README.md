TuplePatternsExamples

This project demonstrates advanced tuple patterns usage in C#. Tuple patterns are used to check tuple data based on specific conditions, introduced in C# 8.0 and later. This project provides examples on how to use pattern matching with tuples to make decisions based on multiple criteria.
Project Structure

The Program.cs file includes examples of:

    Weather and Temperature Advice: Using tuple patterns to provide recommendations based on weather and temperature.
    Math Operations: Using tuple patterns to perform arithmetic operations and handle specific cases like division by zero.

Code Examples

In this project, we cover:

    Using tuple patterns in a switch expression to evaluate multiple conditions simultaneously.
    Handling special cases with when clauses in patterns (e.g., checking for division by zero).
    Simplifying complex if-else conditions with more readable pattern matching.

Example Output

    Weather and Temperature Advice:
    It's sunny and pleasant. Enjoy your day outside!
    It's rainy. Don't forget your umbrella!
    It's cloudy. It might rain, so take a jacket.
    It's snowy and freezing. Dress warmly!
    It's sunny but very hot. Stay hydrated.

    Math Operations Example:
    Enter the first number: 10
    Enter the second number: 0
    Enter an operator (+, -, *, /): /
    Cannot divide by zero.

How to Run

    Clone the repository.
    Open the project in your preferred C# IDE.
    Run the Program.cs file to see the examples of tuple patterns in action.

Purpose

This project is designed for advanced learners who want to explore tuple patterns in C# and see how to use pattern matching to evaluate and act on complex conditions more concisely.
